# A variable holds a value in memory location that is needed for the execution of your program
# A variable can only hold one value at a time
# This value can change throughout the execution 

# Variables must be declared before they can be used

name1 = "John" # declare variable name1 and assign the value "John"
print("Welcome",name1) # returns: Welcome John
name1 = "Peter" # change variable name1 to the value "Peter"
print(f"Welcome {name1}") # returns: Welcome Peter

# TASK 3 - use input function
num1 = int(input("Enter your first number: ")) # similar to prompt in JavaScript. Returns string value, so need to use int to convert it
# use a variable and invoke the input function to ask the user for a second number
num2 = int(input("Enter your second number: "))
# add the two numbers

# print out the total of the two numbers
