# Converting a value from one data type to another is known as casting

# https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html


# To convert values to different data types, you need to know the functions that are available to you.
# Here are the most common functions that you will need to know.
# You can find these in the Python documentation.
#
# # convert to string
# str()
# # convert to integer
# int()
# # convert to float
# float()

# Create a 
# b = bytes(1st)
# print(type(b),"\n") #returns list type class
# print(b,"\n")

# converting a list into 
#b1 = 
#print(type(b1))
 
# Numeric data types
# type conversion functions
num1 = 13
num2 = 100
num3 = -66 

print(9<8)

print(type(num1), type(num2), type(num3),
      type(num1), type(num2), type(num3),
      type(num1), type(num2), type(num3))
# num10 = num4
